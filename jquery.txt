jQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library that is based on the principle "write less, do more". It's easy-to-use APIs makes the things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, adding animation effects to a web page much simpler that works seamlessly across all the major browsers. jQuery also gives you the ability to create an Ajax based application in a quick and simple way.
Companies like Google, Microsoft and IBM are using the jQuery for their applications. So you can easily understand how popular the jQuery is?
 
 
Advantages of jQuery

The biggest advantage of jQuery comes from its selectors that allow you to traverse the DOM tree of an HTML document's structure in an efficient manner.

Additionally, using the jQuery inbuilt methods you can create animations and effects like sliding transition, showing or hiding an element, etc. with a single line of code.
 
Here are some more advantages, why one should opt for jQuery:

Save lots of time — You can save lots of time and efforts by using the jQuery inbuilt effects and selectors and concentrate on other development work.

Simplify common JavaScript tasks — jQuery considerably simplifies the common JavaScript tasks. Now you can easily create feature rich and interactive web pages with fewer lines of codes, a typical example is retrieving the information from a server and updates the page without refreshing.

Easy to use — jQuery is very easy to use. Anybody with the basic working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript can start development with jQuery.

Compatible with browsers — jQuery is created with modern browsers in mind and it is compatible with all major modern browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Opera.

Absolutely Free — And the best part is, it is completely free to download and use.
 
Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages:
There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:
Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google
 
Downloading jQuery:

There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed

Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)

Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

<head>
<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
Note: Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it.
 
jQuery CDN:

If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.
 
To use jQuery from Google or Microsoft, use one of the following:
 
 
 
Google CDN:
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
  
Microsoft CDN:
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
 
 
jQuery Syntax:

With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.

The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)


Examples:
$(this).hide() - hides the current element.
$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".
 
The Document Ready Event:
$(document).ready(function(){
  		 // jQuery methods go here...
});
 
This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it. This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.

Here are some examples of actions that can fail if methods are run before the document is fully loaded:
Trying to hide an element that is not created yet
Trying to get the size of an image that is not loaded yet
Note: The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the document ready event:
	$(function(){
 
 		  // jQuery methods go here...
 
});
 
Note: Use the syntax you prefer. We think that the document ready event is easier to understand when reading the code.
 
jQuery Selectors:
jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).
jQuery selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes and much more. It's based on the existing CSS Selectors, and in addition, it has some own custom selectors.
All selectors in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().

The element Selector:
The jQuery element selector selects elements based on the element name.
You can select all <p> elements on a page like this:
Eg: 	$("p")


The #id Selector: 
The jQuery #id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element.
An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the #id selector when you want to find a single, unique element.
To find an element with a specific id, write a hash character, followed by the id of the HTML element:
$("#username")


The .class Selector
The jQuery class selector finds elements with a specific class.
To find elements with a specific class, write a period character, followed by the name of the class:
$(".userdetail")

Jquery Events:

An event represents the precise moment when something happens.
Examples:
moving a mouse over an element
selecting a radio button
clicking on an element
The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".

jQuery Syntax For Event Methods:

In jQuery, most DOM events have an equivalent jQuery method.
To assign a click event to all paragraphs on a page, you can do this:
$("p").click();
The next step is to define what should happen when the event fires. You must pass a function to the event:
$("p").click(function(){
 		 // action goes here!!
});


jQuery Fading Methods
With jQuery you can fade an element in and out of visibility.

jQuery has the following fade methods:

fadeIn()
fadeOut()
fadeToggle()
fadeTo()
jQuery fadeIn() Method
The jQuery fadeIn() method is used to fade in a hidden element.

Syntax:

$(selector).fadeIn(speed,callback);
The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds.

The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the fading completes.

The following example demonstrates the fadeIn() method with different parameters:

jQuery Sliding Methods
With jQuery you can create a sliding effect on elements.

jQuery has the following slide methods:

slideDown()
slideUp()
slideToggle()
jQuery slideDown() Method
The jQuery slideDown() method is used to slide down an element.

Syntax:

$(selector).slideDown(speed,callback);
The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds.

The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the sliding completes.

The following example demonstrates the slideDown() method:
